<center><b><h3>Da Vinci Sydrome</h3></b></center>
Imagine a flow of data through a brain. The idea for your product mock-up begins to form at the beginning. You then start to sketch your idea out more and more, as this data continues to make its way down the long winding road that is your brain. In an artists’ brain, this flow of data would get to the half way point, then continue and complete the product mock-up. In contrast, when a hybrids’ meets the half way point, it continues into the engineer half. That’s the point you start to day dream about new features and how to implement them, and then you finally abandon the sketch altogether and hit the breadboard.

But this isn’t always a bad thing. With every problem, there is a solution how ever complex or tricky it may be. People like this tend to make great project managers or team leaders because they know their way around all fields. For example, they can tell your graphic design team their vision in a way a graphic designer can understand, even using proper vocabulary! The same goes for your engineering department.

The products da Vinci did complete were only done because of his “team”, as he was able to dabble in it all and lead each of his “departments”. So don’t feel frustrated or torn when you feel you can’t make up your mind of which direction to choose. In truth, you don’t have to sacrifice one or the other; simply take a few programming and electrical classes along with your art classes (or the other way around depending on your major). Both directions can more than benefit from each other.
