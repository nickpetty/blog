<center><h3><b>Horseshoe Tunica Poker Room TV Control System</b></h3></center>
<p>
I currently work for Caesars Entertainment in Tunica, MS in the Audio/Visual Department.  Most AV departments have simple tasks such as setups and breakdowns of equipment for meetings.  That is one part of our job, however, over the last few years, more and more things get dropped into our laps.  The main being handling the digital signage for the three owned properties in Tunica (Horseshoe, Harrah’s, and Roadhouse).  A few months ago, we got word the poker room at Horseshoe was going to be remolded and are wanting all new televisions with DirecTV.  During a meeting about this, the poker room manager asked if we should get an outside company to handle it because of what she was wanting.  I asked her to explain what she wanted, and I’ll see what I can do.

<p>

With the number of poker tournaments they have, and at different parts of the poker room, she wanted the ability to source one of three “poker clocks” to any of the televisions.  Our original idea was to simply split the video signal from each “clock/computer” to one of four inputs on each TV.  This would mean each television would have four inputs; DirecTV and clock 1-3.  Instead, an idea came to mind.  I had already built a remote DirecTV library for web control of a box we use in a video system at Harrah’s, so I figured I could do the same thing here.

<p>

Our video switching system uses equipment from a company called Magenta Research.  The product we use is called Mondo Matrix.  It is a video over Ethernet switcher.  A transmitter with an HD-15 port is used for the source and outputs via Ethernet to the Mondo.  The Mondo then outputs via Ethernet to a receiver and outputs back over HD-15.  Very plug-and-play.  Each Mondo unit can have up to 64 inputs and 16 outputs.  If more outputs are needed, another Mondo is installed and the inputs are cascaded over.  After a little exploration behind the scenes of this whole system, I found out it was being controlled via serial.

<p>

Looking through the manual, I discovered all the commands.  Sending ‘D’ would print the whole map presented in a format as such – ’001 A010 V010′.  ’001′ being the output, ‘A010′ being the input number for Audio to that output, and ‘V010′ being the input number for Video to that output.  The Mondo allows for audio and video from an input to routed to separate outputs (of course, one input can be routed to multiple outputs).  So sending ‘Bxxxyyy’ would route both audio and video from an input (xxx), to an output (yyy).   Or you could send ‘Axxxyyy’ for audio and ‘Vxxxyyy’ for video.  From there, I made a simple python library for full control.

Because I would be using the Mondo to route all my video, all the DirecTV boxes would have to be installed in the rack.  At 13 boxes, it will be a little difficult to have to go to the closet and cover all the other receivers while trying to change the one you want with the remote.  For this, I ported my DTVControl gem from ruby over to python.  Now that I had all my libraries ready, it was time to work on the control interface.

<p> 

A while back, before I worked here, our department was given 25 or so 5-inch touchscreens originally used as ordering menus for slot machines.  For a while, the only use for them was monitors for DirecTV boxes providing music only for some locations.  When I discovered they were touchscreen, I quickly pulled them apart to find a model number.  They turned out to be EETI eGalax touchscreens.  The drivers also included multi-screen touch capabilities (the ability to have multiple screens and decipher which screen was being touched).  These turned out to be perfect for what I had planned.

Using python and TK (the best gui toolkit I knew at the time), I threw together the control interface.   This would work by the operator first selecting the output (television) they wanted to control, then pressing one of four inputs (sources).  Pressing Bravo One-Three would source one of the three clocks to the television.  Pressing DTV would source the DTV box for that screen (each television has it’s own DTV box on inputs 1-13, they don’t share).  In order to control a DirecTV box, an output is selected and can then be controlled by the buttons on the second touch screen.  This is all web controlled.  Each box has an IP of 192.168.1.101-113.  A config file tells the script which IP to use.

<p>

A problem we faced during installation almost scratched the whole project.  After spending a few days hanging and mounting televisions, we wanted to test out part of the system.  We hooked up a DirecTV box via a component to HD-15 cable to a transmitter.  From the transmitter we bypassed the switcher and plugged directly up to the Cat-5 cable feeding one of the televisions.  On the other end, the Cat-5 cable went to a receiver, and from the receiver, VGA to VGA on the television.  It came as a bit of a surprise when this did not work.  After a bit of research, we found out why.  There is a syncing issue between VGA and Component.  This means the HD-15 to Component cables would not work.  We would need actual converters.  Finding one from monoprice.com, we quickly rushed ordered thirteen of them and got them in the next day.  Needless to say, this worked beautifully!

It’s been about two weeks since the poker room opened and everything is going great.  No over heating issues, no failures, nothing… so far.  Our final setup consist of:
<p>
<em>
DTV(network-controlled)–[component]–>Component-to-VGA-Converter–[vga]–>Magenta-Transmitter–[cat-5]–>Mondo-Matrix–[cat-5]–>Magenta-Receiver–[vga]–>Television.
All DirecTV boxes are transmitting beautifully in 1080i.

This was a dream of mine and I saw it all the way through.  But not without the help of my co-workers and my best friend.
