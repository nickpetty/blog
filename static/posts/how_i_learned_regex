There was a time, when looking for a solution to a problem, that I would come across a simple line of regex to fix my problem.  To be honest, I didn’t want to use something that I didn’t understand in any of my code, especially in production.  I was so scared of what seemed to be so hard to use or learn, that I would rather type tens of unstable lines of code to do that exact same thing.  Then one day I just decided out of the blue… let’s learn how to read and write regular expressions.  With a quick Google, I found many sites offering tutorials and classes.  This was probably the hardest part: finding something that wouldn’t be too easy that I wouldn’t learn anything, but not too hard that it would turn me off completely.

<b>RegexOne</b>

RegexOne was the second site I came across (the first site being ‘Learning RegEx The Hard Way’, but it wasn’t quite my speed).  At first, it seemed to be lacking a few things,  almost as if it required you to know just a little about regular expressions already.  However, any time I didn’t have a full understanding about a special character or pattern, I would just Google it or check the reference for my language of choice, Python.  Once I got through all of the tutorials and practical examples, I had a large amount of confidence in knowing how to write a regular expression. And it only took me one day.

The days after completing RegexOne, I decided that I would replace the complicated bits of a parser function in a script I was working on.  As I experimented, I decreased the lines in the function from six… to just one.  While experimenting with this parser function, I found that I needed a quick way to test out parts of the expression and make sure I was understanding what I was typing.  This is where Pythex came in, an online regular expression tester.  Bookmark this.  It will come in handy many, many times.

<b>Practice with Games</b>

Even after almost a week of surrounding myself with as many regular expressions as I could- so as to beat it into my head, I still felt I wasn’t being challenged enough. This was when I found Regex Crossword.  The site contains many crossword puzzles that are solved with matching regular expressions.  Being cocky, I skipped the Tutorial section and moved onto the Beginner section.  Don’t do this.  Take a few minutes to go through the ‘How to play’ and ‘Tutorial’ section because this will give you a perfect understanding of what’s going on.  I finished all of the puzzles in a total of four hours, two hours one night and two more the next morning.  The last puzzle took me an hour, only because I was being stupid and not paying attention to every part of every expression. So pay attention.

<b>Mastering with experience</b>

So this is the point I’m at now.  After completing the puzzles, I feel better than ever in knowing how to read or write regular expressions.  I did face a few challenges; mainly, being with how to properly use the RE module in python, but once I glanced over the docs for the module, things began to make more sense.  What I thought was going to be this complicated tool that only computer scientists and elite software engineers were privileged to know, turned out to be the quickest and easiest thing I’ve ever learned.  It truly is a wonderful tool to have in your toolbox.
